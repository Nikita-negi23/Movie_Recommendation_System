# IMPORTING MACHINE LEARNING MODULES 

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer  # code

NOTES:-
sklearn - scikit-learn ( Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction. )
